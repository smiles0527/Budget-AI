Competition Category: Independent Business Plan


Overview: The Independent Business Plan Event involves the development of a comprehensive proposal to start a new business. Any type of business may be used.


Business Idea: A visual mobile app that tracks expenses. Designed for students and young professionals, this app allows users to simply snap a photo of receipts or purchases, and the AI automatically categorizes expenses into interactive charts and dashboards. The app then gamifies money management with savings goals, spending trend alerts, and shareable progress badges, making budgeting simple and fun.

Background Research Topics:

1. Does it fit under the restrictions of your DECA category


Our idea fits under the DECA Independent Business Plan category because it is a new and independent startup concept that introduces a new approach to budgeting through AI-powered photo recognition and gamification. Unlike traditional finance apps that may be too complicated or tiresome, our idea is designed to be simple and engaging. We are primarily targeting Gen Z and young professionals who need easy money management tools, whether it's for learning or realistic scenarios. We believe that the idea is feasible with existing technology, while backed by research showing a strong demand (59% of Gen Z often run into overspending, and 72% of Gen Z have taken steps to improve their financial health within the past year). That being said, our idea can be developed into a comprehensive business plan with clear marketing and financial strategies, aligning with DECA’s requirement to create a realistic proposal for a brand-new business.


2. Evidence to support the feasibility of your idea/research plan


Market Demand & Consumer Behavior


According to a 2023 Bank of America study, 72% of Gen Z adults have already taken steps to improve their financial health, including budgeting and saving. This shows a strong willingness to engage with money management tools.


Deloitte’s 2024 Gen Z and Millennial Survey highlights that Gen Z and Millennials are highly concerned about financial security and are actively seeking new ways to manage money in the face of rising living costs


The Global Personal Finance Mobile App Market size is expected to be worth around USD 53.6 billion by 2033, from USD 10.1 billion in 2023, growing at a CAGR of 18.2% during the forecast period from 2024 to 2033, proving that there is room for new entrants that serve specific niches like Gen Z.


Competitor Gaps


Existing apps like Mint are often seen as too complex or outdated, while kid-focused apps (Greenlight, BusyKid, GoHenry, etc.) target families rather than independent young adults.


Our idea fills this gap by being visual focused, photo-based, and designed for young, independent users, not kids or advanced financial planners.


Technological Feasibility
This is realistic to build as the technology already exists and is already used in many apps.
Receipt scanning (OCR tech)
We can use existing tools that let phones read text from pictures (e.g., how Google Lens works)
Regarding building the website, we can use standard phone app builders (such as react native, SwiftUI), so it works both on iPhones and Androids. Charts and graphs are easily built with Python.
Services like Google Cloud, AWS, or Firebase let us safely store data and keep accounts secure. Spending info will be encrypted, so no one outside the user sees it
First version (MVP) would just let users take photos of receipts and see spending categories, would incorporate a step-by-step roll-outt strategy so later versions could add saving challenges, streaks, and local business deals once we have more user.s


Some extra stuff we could consider
APIs from banks, payment processors, or cashback platforms could be integrated for features like affiliate recommendations or “Smart Savings Spots”.
Existing SDKs for financial data aggregation (e.g. plaid, truelayer) reduce complexity and ensure compliance with financial regulations
AES-256 for data at rest, TLS for data in transit (encryption protocols)







Practical Feasibility


The app can launch as a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) with core features (receipt scanning + category tracking) on a single university campus.


Partnerships with universities, nonprofits, and financial literacy programs provide low-cost entry into the student market.


The free and premium subscription model has already proven successful in apps like Headspace and Duolingo, showing that Gen Z is willing to pay for value-added features.






3. Any potential problems regarding your idea/plan and how you might address it. 


People may not want to share their purchases to a third party - we can solve this problem by making our site extremely secure and have a privacy and policy etc insuring complete safeguard on spending info
Marketing problems and startup costs problems as apps are very complicated to develop ( a lot of different parts ex. Incorporating smart saving spots and creating a ai that can determine spending through snapshots) - we can solve this by receiving funding from investors and educators who believe in this project focused on a younger audience
Lots of potential competition, we will mitigate this risk by ensuring that our system is cheaper to make and easier to use compared to others, as we are targeting a younger audience compared to other similar competitors

Financial App Market Size, Growth, Demand & Statistics by 2033




















SUMMARY
Industry = personal finance mobile applications ($53B+ global market crowiing at 18% CAGR)
Gen Z struggles with overspending but finds most financial toosl too complex, boring, or made for families
We propose a lightweight, gamified visual-first budgieting app taht requires no manual entry


Market analysis
Primary target = gen z (15-24), college/high school students, young professionals
secondary target = parents, small households, university students learning about financial literacy


Market trends
72% of gen z adults already take steps to improve financial help
Prefers apps that are visual, simple, and gamified


Possible competitors
Mint: comprehensive, too complex
greenlight/busykid: for children and families, not independent adults/teenagers
Our idea fills the gap for young, independent users with ai + gamification


Revenue model
subscriptions
Free = limit scans + basic charts
Premium (4.99/month or 49/year) = unlimited scans, advanced features, ad-free 
Affiliate partnerships possible?
card/bank referrals with $25-75 fee / signup
Business sponsorships?? 
Local restaurants and stores as “smart savings spots”??
Data insights, ofc (aggregated reports) - privacy first
Educational licensing??
Schools and nonprofits pay per-student or per-license


Risk analysis
Privacy 
Requires bank-level encryption and transparent policies
Development costs
Starts with mvp, secure funding possible grants/investors
Competition = focus on Gen Z niche, gamification, and simple design




Technical specifications
OCR (receipt scanning)
Automatic categorizatoin
Simple charts (py)
